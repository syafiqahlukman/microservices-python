#/etc/hosts file is used to manually map domain names to IP addresses on your local machine. 
#When you enter a domain name (e.g., rabbitmq-manager.com) in your browser, your computer needs to resolve that domain to an IP address to know where to send the request.
#In a production setup, domain names are resolved via DNS (Domain Name System) to the public IP address of the server hosting the application. 
#This means youâ€™ll configure your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, AWS Route 53) to resolve your domain name to the IP address of the Ingress controller or the load balancer.
#However, in a local development environment, you may not have a DNS server, and the domain name (rabbitmq-manager.com) won't automatically point to the correct IP address.
